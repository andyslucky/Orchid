**This is a major release, which contains several breaking changes. Read carefully, your site might not properly 
if you do not update you site in line with these changes.**

### Notable New Features

- orchid-javadoc-feature no longer requires a separate Gradle plugin! The Orchid plugin will take care of starting and running 
    the Javadoc program and does not rely on Gradle doing it for you. **This means that the 
    `com.eden.orchidJavadocPlugin` Gradle plugin has been removed, and you must remove it from your `build.gradle` 
    scripts.**
- Parsing command line flags now uses the same Options extraction framework as the rest of Orchid, and so is much easier
    to add custom flags.
- Refactors resource source APIs to be more extensible. 

### Breaking Changes for End-users

- `com.eden.orchidJavadocPlugin` no longer exists in v0.10.0 and above, and must be removed from your build scripts
- FastClasspathScanner APIs have been changed significantly, and the project renamed to ClassGraph. Refer to the new
    [ClassGraph Wiki](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/wiki) to see how to migrate your code.
