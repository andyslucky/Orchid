- Removes restrictions on filenames that can be used for assets. CSS assets no longer requires a `.css` extension, and
    likewise JavaScript assets no longer require a `.js` extension. It's up to you to make sure an asset is valid or not
    before it gets added to the page.
- When creating a Reference to a file that is not a child of the base dir, remove relative path segments so that it will
    be copied properly to the rendered site, and not outside of the build dir. 
- Adds `kotlinPlayground` component to the `orchid-syntax-highlighter-feature` artifact, for converting Kotlin code snippets into
    runnable playgrounds.
