- New Spotify tag added {{ anchor('orchid-writers-blocks-feature') }} plugin, to embed a Spotify track or playlist. Thanks 
    @singularsyntax for the great addition!
- Great news for Scala users, you can now run Orchid from an SBT build! Thanks to the incredible work by @swaldman, 
    adding the `orchidSbtPlugin` will allow you to run and serve Orchid builds directly from your existing SBT projects.
    Full setup instructions and commands can be found on the {{ anchor('Quick-Start') }} page.
