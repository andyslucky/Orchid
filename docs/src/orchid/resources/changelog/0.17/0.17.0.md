## Improvements and Bugfixes

- **Netlify Publisher**
    - Now handles uploads of really large sites. Previously, deploys of more than a couple thousand pages or so would 
        time out and fail.
    - It can infer the Netlify siteId from the Orchid base URL, and is now an optional property
- **Wikis**
    - PDF ebooks generated by Wiki plugin are now included in a Collection, so they can be linked to with the linking 
        functions and in menus
    - Fixed bug creating PDF ebooks for multiple sections
- **Changelogs**
    - Adds Archetype to Changelog entries from `changelog.allVersions` in `config.yml`
    - Version bumps are inferred from changelog entries, and no longer need to be manually entered
    - Improves formatting of `meta/versions.json` file. Release notes can now be embedded in this JSON file
- **Other**
    - Improves console output of Git-based publishers and Swiftdoc plugin
    - Swiftdoc plugin now accepts a list of source roots to find Swift sources, rather than a single directory
    - `.puml` file extension is now recognized as a PlantUML file by default
    - Fixed NPE calling a TemplateFunction as a Clog-formatted string
    - Fixes formatting of dates in sitemap XML files so as to not cause warnings from Google indices
