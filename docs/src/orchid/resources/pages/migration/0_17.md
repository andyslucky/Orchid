## 0.17.0 Migration Guide

- The key for the Github Pages publisher has renamed. Change `ghPages` to `githubPages` in your `config.yml` publication
    pipeline
- The `baseDir` property in Swiftdoc plugin configuration has been changed to `sourceDirs` to match other code-doc 
    plugins, and now accepts either a single String or a list of Strings as a value.
- The Github Pages publisher has been moved out of `orchid-core` and into the {{ anchor('orchid-github-feature') }} integration
    project. Likewise, the Github Releases publisher has been moved from `orchid-changelog-feature` to `orchid-github-feature`, and the 
    `githubProject()` global collection has been moved from `orchid-copper-theme` to `orchid-github-feature`. Add the
    `io.github.copper-leaf.orchid:orchid-github-feature:{{site.version}}` dependency to continue using these features
- The Netlify publisher has been moved out of `orchid-core` and into the {{ anchor('orchid-netlify-feature') }} integration
    project. Add the `io.github.copper-leaf.orchid:orchid-netlify-feature:{{site.version}}` dependency to continue using the Netlify 
    publisher
- The following "spells" supported by Clog have been removed: [ `baseUrl`, `baseUrlScheme`, `baseUrlHost`, 
    `baseUrlPort`, `baseUrlRoot`, `version`, `orchidVersion`, `env` ] . Instead, use the normal TemplateFunctions within 
    Clog-formatted strings for `baseUrl`, and create TemplateFunctions for your site as a local plugin if your need the
    other Clog spells
- The `changelogVersionPicker` component has been removed, as it has not worked for quite a while. You should create 
    this component yourself using Javascript to match your theme
- **Notable dependency changes**
    - Flexmark `Extensions` have changed packages. Custom Flexmark extensions now must be of the type 
    `com.vladsch.flexmark.util.builder.Extension`
